Mission Statement:

Scribbl.me is a note-sharing platform built with collaboration in mind, geared towards 
power-users, students, and professionals alike with one goal in mind: interoperability.

At Scribbl, we believe that taking a note should be as simple as flipping open a 
notepad and scribbling down something.
 
However, the graphite pencil and notepad that could be found in the hands of 
any good journalist in the past century has now been replaced with the modern-day
smartphone, tablet, or laptop computer.

Scribbl looks to provide a note taking service that emphasizes ease-of-use,
flexibility, accessibility, and user-efficiency while promoting collaboration in a
medium that is equally accessible regardless of the platform being used.


This project was officially started on October 20, 2017.
